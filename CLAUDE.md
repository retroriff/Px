## üéØ Slash Commands

This repository has two distinct modes. Use the appropriate slash command to load the relevant documentation:

- `/dev` - **Development Mode** - Modifying code and adding features
- `/play` - **Music Creation Mode** - Writing live coding music

These commands will load only the relevant documentation for each task, saving tokens.

## Purpose

This repository is used for two distinct purposes:

1. **‚ö°Ô∏è Development** - Modifying code and adding features (use `/dev`)
2. **üéõÔ∏è Music Creation** - Writing live coding music (use `/play`)

**`AGENTS.md` will route you to the correct documentation** based on which task the user is requesting. This prevents loading unnecessary documentation and saves tokens.

**Do not read all documentation** - be selective based on task type as specified in `AGENTS.md`.
