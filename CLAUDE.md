## üéØ Start of Conversation

**IMPORTANT: At the very start of EVERY new conversation, IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY present the user with these two options WITHOUT waiting for them to ask:**

1. **‚ö°Ô∏è Development** - Modifying code and adding features
2. **üéõÔ∏è Music Creation** - Writing live coding music

Ask which mode they're working in, then follow the routing guide in `AGENTS.md` to load only the relevant documentation.

This should be the FIRST thing you do in any new conversation - do not wait for the user to request it.

## Purpose

This repository is used for two distinct purposes:

1. **‚ö°Ô∏è Development** - Modifying code and adding features
2. **üéõÔ∏è Music Creation** - Writing live coding music

**`AGENTS.md` will route you to the correct documentation** based on which task the user is requesting. This prevents loading unnecessary documentation and saves tokens.

**Do not read all documentation** - be selective based on task type as specified in `AGENTS.md`.
