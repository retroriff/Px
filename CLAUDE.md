# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ READ `AGENTS.md` FIRST** - It contains the task routing guide for this project.

---

This repository is used for two distinct purposes:

1. **Music Creation** - Writing live coding patterns
2. **Development** - Modifying code and adding features

**`AGENTS.md` will route you to the correct documentation** based on which task the user is requesting. This prevents loading unnecessary documentation and saves tokens.

**Do not read all documentation** - be selective based on task type as specified in `AGENTS.md`.
