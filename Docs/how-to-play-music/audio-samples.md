# Audio Samples Guide

**Note**: This document is for **music creation tasks only**. For development tasks, see `AGENTS.md` routing guide.

## Audio samples files

We use all sample audio files from `~/icloud/Music/Samples/Live\ Coding`. You should read all its folders and files to learn which samples refenrences can be played.

## How to reference an audio sample file

Samples are organized in folders, and each is called using it's file index sorted alphabetically. For example, when the first file in the `pop-2` folder is `0`, and must be called `pop-2:0`. When the index is not provided, 0 is the default index number. So it can be called just `pop-2`.
